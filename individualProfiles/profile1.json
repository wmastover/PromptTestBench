        "aboutDescripton": "Put simply, I get B2B SaaS startups where they need to be with their business. It's been a very strange road how I got here though:I was working at a Big-4 consulting company when I realized I don't see myself working at the office for 40 years. I made a leap of faith and got into entrepreneurship. In my early twenties, I launched e-com businesses and tried out dropshipping hustles: jewelry, techwear backpacks, and even dog toys.Ecom was working, but I was up for a bigger challenge. And that's how I got into startups.Having no technical co-founder, I learned no-code tools and built products solo.Next, came years of mistakes, books, and more mistakes:Undercharging for products, pivoting every 2 months, spending too long to get market feedback - you name it.Eventually, I got a MentalTech platform to traction, and that was the best feeling ever.Other founders started asking for my help.Thatâ€˜s how I got into coaching, which over time has grown into my Private Accelerator SaaS Camp.Over time, I coached over 70 entrepreneurs, from idea stage students to CEOs of startups with 32M valuation. I say things as they are, make founders shift their perception of \"possible\" and ask challenging questions nobody else would ask you. In 2022, my marketing strategies generated 1.1M for startups with 0 ad spend. If you're an early-stage SaaS founder, head over to saascamp.co to learn more about how I can help.
